## How to Update Your Website

Whenever you want to make changes to your website, follow these steps:

1. Make changes to your local files
2. Commit the changes to your local repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```
3. Push the changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
4. GitHub Pages will automatically update your site within a few minutes

## Common Issues and Solutions

### If your site doesn't appear after setting up GitHub Pages:
- Make sure you've selected the correct branch in the GitHub Pages settings
- Check that your index.html file is in the root of the repository
- Wait a few minutes as it can take time for changes to propagate

### If styles or images aren't loading:
- Make sure all your file paths are relative (they should start with "./assets/" or just "assets/")
- Check for case sensitivity in file names and paths
- Verify that all resource files have been pushed to the repository

### If the form submission doesn't work:
- Make sure the Google Form is still active and accepting responses
- Check that the form entry ID is correct
- Consider using the browser's developer console to check for any CORS errors

## Domain Settings

If you want to use a custom domain with your GitHub Pages site:
1. Add your custom domain in the GitHub Pages settings
2. Create a CNAME record with your domain registrar
3. Create a file named `CNAME` in your repository with your domain name
